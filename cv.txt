   Various
   2017-2018
     * https://github.com/srycyk/templet_rails A Rails mini-framework that
       replaces traditional controller and view scaffolding. It dispenses
       with markup scripts (ERb, HAML, etc.) and (your own) custom Helper
       methods. Instead, view rendering is carried out by a single Ruby
       class, which is called from, and is similar to, a regular
       Controller. It provides a bit more functionality than scaffolding
       does, but more, it encourages a wholly object oriented approach to
       writing views. To see how the framework works, the best place to
       start is the demo Rails application, questionable.
     * http://niads.co.uk An attempt to broaden my options by becoming
       self-employed. To promote this venture, I've written a scraper to
       find potential clients by extracting data from business directory
       sites.
     * https://github.com/srycyk/mine A multi-featured web page scraping
       framework built from scratch. Although quite intricate inside, it
       exposes a simple top level interface that cuts down the retrieval
       of a set of related pages into a few lines of code.
     * https://github.com/srycyk/visitor A small standard Rails site to
       bookmark URL's. It has nested tagging, imports & exports, and
       DRY'ed up views.
     * https://github.com/srycyk/radio. A rough, but ready, site that
       lists BBC radio programmes. It has a Rails back-end and a React
       front-end. I wrote it mainly to practise React, but I do use it
       myself.
     * Short-term freelancing jobs in education and GDPR compliance using
       Rails.

   FMA, Boulder, Colorado, USA
   2015-2016

       including geo-location searches, user enrollment, credit card
       registration & charging (with Authorize.net), invoicing, API
       accessing, and data distribution.
     * Enhancements to http://proxyrain.com, a IP address balancing proxy
       service, and minor changes to an account management site for
       clients' private use.

     * Produced decoupled modules for the mass registration of students,
       receiving data (as CSV and JSON) via HTTP API's and an FTP drop-in.

       data to third-party systems.

   Freelancing

     * Developed an email-based app, for estateagencyallstars.co.uk, that
       receives, reconciles and delivers emails (to estate agents) from
       job applications (consisting of a CV, psychometric test and video
       presentation) by aspiring estate agents.
     * Developed a web-based thesaurus showing metaphors and referential
       information, for Rowdy Labs, USA.
     * Prepared course material introducing authentication in Rails, for
       gotealeaf.com.

   Security Icon, London
   2013-2014
   (Contract)
     * Analysis and development of an administrative dashboard (in Rails)
       which interfaces with credit card payment gateways. The UI provides
       extensive search capabilities, detects misuse, compiles statistics
       on card transactions, creates tiered accounts by invitation
       (Devise) and also uses a Bootstrap template for a pleasing design.
     * Synchronising Couchbase & SQL data-bases, querying Couchbase,
       realistic data generation, graph drawing using the RGraph JS
       library, role-based access authorisation, API compatibility, Ubuntu

       development of a skeletal Rails application (for wire-framing)
       using custom generators, Inherited Resources, generic templates,
       Devise and Twitter Bootstrap 3.
     * Worked on http://runabook.co.uk which is a pooled betting game for
       groups of friends to bet on any upcoming sporting fixtures, but it
       didn't prove popular. It's in Rails and deployed on Heroku, it has
       15K lines of code. Wrote a set of Ruby scripts using the Twitter
       API to target potential users of this game.
     * Also developed, github.com/srycyk/thesaurus. - two one-page
       thesaurus app's, one in Rails, the other in React. It has one of
       the largest vocabularies available, as it's an amalgamation of
       Roget, WordNet, and another thesaurus. It was online at
       http://thesaurus-lexdump.rhcloud.com, but no longer.

       for users per company branch.

       fallback of delivering SMS texts to give notice of route changes.
