              A Rails mini-framework that replaces traditional controller
              and view scaffolding.
              It dispenses with markup scripts (ERb, HAML, etc.) and
              (your own) custom Helper methods.
              Instead, view rendering is carried out by a single Ruby class,
              which is called from, and is similar to, a regular Controller.
              It provides a bit more functionality than scaffolding does,
              but more, it encourages a wholly object oriented approach to
              writing views.
              To see how the framework works, the best place to start is
              the demo Rails application,
              <a href="https://github.com/srycyk/questionable">questionable</a>.

              Although quite intricate inside, it exposes a simple top level
